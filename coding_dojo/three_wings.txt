Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, 
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in halls of stone, 
Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die, 
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne 
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. 
One Wing to rule them all, One Wing to find them, 
One Wing to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. 
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. 

J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings
